        This function genrate a random discretization that can be used in the extended version of Rust(1987) bus 
        engine problem. This algorithm randomly discretize the state space of a variable set of size dim_q ino 
        dim_pi partition where each varaible is in range (0, max_q) using only the first dim_active_q variables.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dim_q : int
            The number of variables in the variabl set.
        dim_active_q : int
            The number of variables that is used to partition the state space. If dim_active_q is 10, it means
            that the partitioning only split the first 10 variables to generate the discretization.
        dim_pi : int
            Number of partitions in the final discretization.
        max_q : int
            The maximum value for each variable.
