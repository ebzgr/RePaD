Here we present a simple example to generate a random discretization using the discretization generator module, 
generate bus engine replacement problem using the generated random discretization by data generator module, 
recover the random partitioning using data-driven discretization algorithm model, and finally recover 
the bus engine replacement problem parameters using the nested fixed point estimated module.

## Recover the discretization
'''
The default values for lambda and smoothing del in the currect case is good enough, so we do not 
use extensive hyper-parameter tuning to tune those parameter, and use the simple hyper-param tuning. 
However, you may want to tune lamb and smoothing_del as well using hyperopt. In this case, we 
use a simple hyper-param optimization. we set a small value for delta small and a maximum number 
of partitions. We then use the performance on the validation set to choose the optimal number of 
partitions.
